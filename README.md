# topdown-game
Simple top down game - for some reason that I don't remember the folder on my computer is called RP, so maybe that stands for the real title of the game.

Use the up arrow key to make the player move towards the mouse. Collect the gems, don't let the bananas hit you, and get to the exit. After you collect the gun (on some levels) you can shoot with the space bar. Bullets go towards the mouse.

The artwork isn't the greatest, but it's the best I could do.

I made this in early 2017.
